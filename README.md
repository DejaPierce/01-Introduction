In my introduction assignment the first task that I accomplished which will be one of the first requirements with every assignment is to electronically sign the License that was given to me in order to make sure to let others know that my work belongs to me. The next task that I was given was to answer the questions that was in the assignment and write it in code in the main.py file. Most of the code was written and an example code was given and all that I had to do was put in my answers to the questions that my professor asked us. I found this to be a very easy assignment, because I just had to follow the code and example that was given to me. For the code I typed print followed by a parenthese and apostrophe. After the apostrophe I put in one of the answers and I closed out the code with an apostrophe and a parenthese. I repeated these steps and in selected the code and ran the file through the terminal using python and it printed out the answers.
